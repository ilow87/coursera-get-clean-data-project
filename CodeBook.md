### Variable Name Transformations
===============================================================================

All variable names were transformed to a different format (lower cases and using "_" to seperate text).
"tm" is used to define time domain signals and "ff" is used to define signals that that gone thorugh Fast Fourier Transformation.


### Value Variable Transformations
===============================================================================

All values have been summarized to obtain the individual mean for each variable, grouped at activity & subject level.
